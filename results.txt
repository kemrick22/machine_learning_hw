Exoplanet Exploration

Using data gathered from the NASA Kepler space telescope, I trained several different models to predict whether a record is a candidate expoplanet. 

I used the following methods to build models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Neighbors, and Support Vector. I also tuned the support vector model with GridSearch. Comparing these models, Random Forests was the most accurate with a test score of 90.5%. Below are the test scores of the other models:

Tuned Support Vector: 88.2%
Logistic Regression: 83.7%
Decision Tree: 84.9%
Support Vector: 84.1%
K Neighbors: 81.7%
